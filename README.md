Very basic simple kotlin app using MVVM Basics.

This project can be great reference for those who are looking forward to learn basics of MVVM in simple clean way.

## What is MVVM ?
Model — View — ViewModel (MVVM) is the industry-recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns.</br>
MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application.

## Libraries Used
JetPack Navigation Component </br>
Lifecycle components / ViewModel and LiveData </br>
Retrofit2 </br>
Glide </br>

## Why These Libraries?

JetPack Navigation Component : to follow the principle of single Activity and multiple fragments.

Lifecycle components / ViewModel and LiveData : to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.

Retrofit2 : to create an HTTP request and also to process the HTTP response from a REST API

Glide : an Image Loader library as well recommended by Google
